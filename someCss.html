        <h1 class="redtext"></h1>Hello. My name is Andrew and I am 20 years old. I am writing this paragraph in a different
            font then the paragraph that will follow to show that I know how to use CSS. CSS and 
            HTML are very interesting and I want to learn more about them and get better at using them.
        </h1>
        <h1><span style="font-family:Arial"> This paragraph is in a different
            font. I had to look up on google how to change fonts because I was having 
            trouble figuring out how to do it. I am excited to see what else I can do with 
            CSS and maybe build a complex website using it in the near future.
